                    What is Imposter Syndrome?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imposter Syndrome also called perceived fraudulence, involves feelings of self-doubt and personal incompetence that persist despite your education, experience, and accomplishments."</p>
                    <p>If you’ve ever felt like an imposter at work, you’re not alone. A 2019 review of 62 studies on imposter syndrome suggested anywhere from 9 to 82 percent of people report having thoughts along these lines at some point.</p>
                    <p>To counter these feelings, you might end up working harder and holding yourself to ever higher standards. This pressure can eventually take a toll on your emotional well-being and your performance.</p>

                <h2>.02 The Different Types of Imposter Syndrome</h2>
                <p>The psychological phenomenon, known as imposter syndrome, reflects a belief that you’re an inadequate and incompetent failure despite evidence that indicates you’re skilled and quite successful.</p>
                <p class="cls-0">Expert on the subject, <a href="https://impostorsyndrome.com/">Dr. Valerie Young</a>, has categorized it into subgroups: the Perfectionist, the Superwoman/man, the Natural Genius, the Soloist, and the Expert. In her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Thoughts-Successful-Women-Impostor/dp/0307452719">The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer From the Imposter Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It</a>, Dr. Young builds on decades of research studying fraudulent feelings among high achievers.</p>

                    <p>
                        Through her personal research, Young uncovered several “competence types”—or internal rules that people who struggle with confidence attempt to follow. This categorization’s often overlooked in the conversation, but her reading of it can be really helpful in identifying bad habits or patterns that may be holding you back from your full potential.

                        <h3>Separate feelings from facts</h3>
                        <p>
                            Chances are, you'll feel imposter syndrom creeping in at some point in your life. "Be ready for those feelings, observe them, be mindful of them and be ready with a response," Dr. Albers suggests. Recognize that just because you think these things don't mean they are true. "If your mind says, 'I don't know what I'm talking about,' remind yourself that you know more than you think you do and are capable of learning."
                        </p>

                        <h3>Take note of your accomplishments</h3>
                        <p>
                            In moments where you feel less-than, it can be helpful to have a tangible reminder of your successes. When your manager sends you an email recognizing your excellent work on a project, save that email in a special folder. If your child makes you a card telling yo uwhat a great parent you are, hang it on the fridge where you'll be able to see it on a day when it feels like nothing's going right.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Stop comparing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Focus on measuring your own achievements instead of holding them up against others'. Comparing your own life to a carefully curated influencer's social media feed, for example, is a trap for feeling like you don't measure up.

                        <h3>Turn imposter syndrom on its head</h3>
                        <p>
                            Remember that smart, high-achieving people most often deal with imposter syndrome. So the very fact tat you recognize it in yourself says a lot about you. "True imposters don't have this feeling," Dr. Albers states. Let that be motivation to continue pushing forward.

                        <p>
                            Sometimes, a good chat with someone who knows you and supports you can help you realize that your imposter feelings are normal but also irrational.

                        <p>
                            A therapist can help you recognize feelings associated with imposter syndrom and create new behaviors to get past them. "Action really helps overcome this," Dr. Albers says. "It's about not getting stuck in the thought of 'I can't do this,' but making sure that you take action and move forward."
